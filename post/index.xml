Especially when you know your consumers and are you&amp;rsquo;re open for feedback and discussion on the contract of the API.
Contract first or Code first? Although I want to share my contract as soon as possible I don&amp;rsquo;t like these API contract designer tools. My approach is often just creating an empty API in Asp.Net Core by defining the controllers and classes that define the contract.</description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://fullcycledeveloper.com/2022/01/14/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fullcycledeveloper.com/2022/01/14/hello-world/</guid><description>As a software developer there is only 1 title you can use to create your first post on a new blog. &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo;. ðŸ‘‹
So why this blog? It&amp;rsquo;s actually my 3rd blog website I created. I started of years ago with a blog using Wordpress that I hosted myself. Then about 6 years ago I was working a lot with Azure and wanted to move away from self hosting so I created a new blog (still using Wordpress) but then hosted on Azure.</description></item></channel></rss>
