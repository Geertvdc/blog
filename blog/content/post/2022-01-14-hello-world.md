As a software developer there is only 1 title you can use to create your first post on a new blog. "Hello World!". ðŸ‘‹

### So why this blog?
It's actually my 3rd blog website I created. I started of years ago with a blog using Wordpress that I hosted myself. Then about 6 years ago I was working a lot with Azure and wanted to move away from self hosting so I created a new blog (still using Wordpress) but then hosted on Azure. This worked quite well at that time but I lost passion for blogging a couple of years ago.

Now I wanted to start writing some blogposts again so I had 2 options: dust of my old blog or create a new one. I never really liked the whole Wordpress experience and wanted to move to a static site generator so this was the right time to make the switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The source of this blog can be found here on my [Github Repo: Geertvdc/geertvdc.github.io](https://github.com/geertvdc/geertvdc.github.io).

### Full cycle developer?
As my dayjob I work as a Senior Consultant at Xpirit where I help companies build better software. I do this by improving the Engineering culture, introduce new technology and coaching employees from CTOs to Developers. I believe that building the best software is done by teams who follow the DevOps mantra: "You build it, you run it!". I love this mantra and try to improve teams on all aspects from architecture, design, implementation, testing, deployments, maintenance, and support. That's why I called this blog "The full cycle developer blog".

### Sharing Knowledge
Sharing Knowledge is one of my passions. Either by writing articles or blogposts but also by public speaking at international conferences and meetups. 

### What to expect on this blog?
Posts by me on this blog can cover all aspects of software development from technical posts about a certain technology to non technical posts about organizational culture or personal development.

### So who am I?
My name is Geert van der Cruijsen. I'm a senior consultant working at Xpirit in the Netherlands but more important i'm also a husband of my wife Patty and father of my daughters Lauren & Amber.
