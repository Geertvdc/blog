When building APIs I often want to share my contract as soon as possible. Especially when you know your consumers and are you're open for feedback and discussion on the contract of the API.

## My blog using Hugo, what is in the box?
- Hugo CMS
- Finding a theme
- Algolia Search
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Github discussions for comments using Giscuss
- Automatically deploy using Github Pages
