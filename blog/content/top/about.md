## Geert van der Cruijsen
ðŸ‘‹ Hi i'm Geert van der Cruijsen. I'm a senior consultant working at Xpirit and I love helping others build better software. I do this through my job as a consultant for various companies but I also love to share knowledge in the community as public speaker and writer of articles and this blog.

I Like tinkering with new technology and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills. My focus is on building cloud native solutions & DevOps practices.

### Full cycle developer
I think building modern software needs a modern way of building it. I'm a true believer of the DevOps mantra: "You build it, you run it!". When you do this your development team should focus on all aspects of the software development lifecycle. This includes: architecture, design, implementation, testing, deployments, maintenance, and support. I like to make the whole process of delivering value better on all of these aspects. That's why I'm a full cycle developer.
